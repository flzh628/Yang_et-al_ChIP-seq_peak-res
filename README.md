# Yang_et-al_ChIP-seq_peak-res
Peak callings of ChIP-seq data in the 'Yang et al. Nascent-RNA facilitated chromatin silencing of ABA biosynthesis genes permits seed germination in Arabidopsis'.

Peak calling: PePr (version: 1.1.24) (-w 100 --threshold 0.01) and other parameters were default.

The identified peaks were filtered according to the following criteria: (i) peak length ≥ 400 bp; (ii) fold change value (over input or between samples) ≥ 1.5; and (iii) p value no more than 1e-5.
